##run_analysis.R 
file is a file with sets of instruction in R which makes the raw data (data collected from the accelerometers from the 
Samsung Galaxy S smartphone) clean using following steps:

*Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
 (I was not sure if the Inertial Signals should be included, so i wrote this code as an option)
*Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
*Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
*Labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
*Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

==================================================================

##Results
==================================================================
Two tidy data sets are generated
